## Responsiveness

Responsiveness `fixed` means that the ai2html div will appear only at the size it was created in Illustrator and will not change sizes if the container it is placed in changes size. This is the default behavior. 

{% include ex01.html %}

In contrast, `dynamic` responsiveness means that the ai2html divs will scale to fill the container they are placed in.
